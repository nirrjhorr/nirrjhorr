Hi there! I‚Äôm **Md Hasan Al Rashid** ‚Äî a dedicated **Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** enthusiast with a knack for breaking things (on purpose) to make them better. I enjoy uncovering bugs, enhancing usability, and making sure every feature works as intended.

üß© With a **strong academic background**, hands-on **internship and startup experience**, and a natural curiosity to explore, I constantly strive to improve both the products I test and the way I test them.

üéØ **Goal**: To become a modern QA expert and focusing on QA-driven development and secure software testing.
