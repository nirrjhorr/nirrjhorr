**Hi,** I‚Äôm **Md Hasan Al Rashid**, a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) enthusiast with a strong foundation in Data Science and Machine Learning. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to improve software quality through rigorous testing and innovative solutions. I‚Äôm deeply curious about software development processes and have experience ensuring software meets performance, security, and usability standards.

Currently, I‚Äôm expanding my expertise in Cybersecurity, focusing on protecting systems and enhancing the security of applications, especially in fintech and government sectors. I also explore Big Data, IoT, and Cloud Computing, knowing these technologies will shape the future of testing and cybersecurity.

I thrive in team environments, applying my problem-solving skills and emotional intelligence to drive project success. With a CGPA of 3.59 in CSE from Daffodil International University, I continue to grow both professionally and personally. Outside of work, I enjoy mobile photography and staying up-to-date with tech trends.
